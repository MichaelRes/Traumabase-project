# Traumabase-project
Working in collaboration with the hospitals of Paris, to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment on trauma patient.

Concerning the code section, I mainly worked on the python notebook. I built different estimators of the ATE (average treatment effect) and used them first on the whole traumabase dataset, then on different clusters given by the doctors.
